        Software has been developed to "crawl" the web and download 
        all publicly accessible information and data files on webpages,
        the Gopher hierarchy, <h1>the Netnews (Usenet)</h1> bulletin board system, 
        and downloadable software.[16] The information collected by these "crawlers" does not include all the information available on the Internet, since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible. To overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites, Archive-It.org was developed in 2005 by the Internet Archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content, and create digital archives.[17]

Crawls are contributed from various sources, some imported from third 
parties and others generated internally by the Archive.[14] 
For example, crawls are contributed by the Sloan Foundation and Alexa, 
crawls run by IA on behalf of NARA and the Internet Memory Foundation, 
mirrors of Common Crawl.[14] The "Worldwide Web Crawls" have been running 
since 2010 and capture the global Web.[14][18]

The frequency 
of snapshot captures varies per website.[14] Websites in the 
"Worldwide Web Crawls" are included in a "crawl list", with the site 
archived once per crawl.[14] A crawl can take months or even years to 
complete depending on size.[14] For example, "Wide Crawl Number 13" 
started on January 9, 2015, and completed on July 11, 2016.[19] However, 
there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time, and a site might be 
included in more than one crawl list, so how often a site is crawled varies 
widely.[14]

As of October 2019, users are limited to 5 archival requests and 
retrievals per minute.
